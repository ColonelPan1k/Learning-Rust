/This is not really any new info/

- A single bit is the smallest piece of data in a digital system
- It can be either 0 or 1, so it can store anything that has only
  two options. 

- A single bit is not enough to encode a number or a piece of text.

- /n/ bits can encode 2^n states
  - Most common value of n is 8, a /byte/, which lets us encode 256 possible
    states. 
  - Can use 256 bytes to represent someone's age, the latin alphabet, etc.
